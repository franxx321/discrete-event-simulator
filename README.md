In this project we developed an airport simulator system, it's goal was to explore the concepts behind simulations, it allows to gather statistics about an airport, 
such as wait times and idle times, while also managing different resources like different kinds of airstirps and supporting different entities such as light or heavy airplanes.
This project was made as a final project for the Models and Simulations Course at Universidad Nacional de San Luis
